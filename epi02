what is difference between dependencies vs Devdependencies?
ans:  Dependencies are the packages that are required for your application to run correctly in a production environment. These packages are essential 
for the normal functioning of your application and are typically needed during runtime. They include libraries, frameworks, and other utilities that your
application relies on to perform its core functionality.
When you deploy your application to a production server or share it with others, these dependencies are necessary for it to work properly.

DevDependencies, on the other hand, are packages that are only required during development and not in the production environment. These packages include 
development tools, testing frameworks, build systems, and other utilities used to support your development workflow.
DevDependencies are not deployed with your application when it goes into production because they are not needed for the end-users to use the application.

List out the 5 superpowers of parcel and describe them any 3 of them?
ans:--> Zero Configuration: Parcel is known for its zero-configuration setup, which means you can start using it right away without the need for complex 
configuration files. It automatically handles various aspects of your project, like transpiling, bundling, and code splitting, using sensible defaults. This simplicity allows developers to focus more on writing code and less on configuring build tools.

    -->Automatic Asset Resolution: Parcel can handle various asset types, such as JavaScript, CSS, HTML, images, and more, without requiring explicit 
    imports or configurations. It automatically recognizes dependencies from your code and bundles them appropriately, streamlining the development process 
    and reducing manual intervention.

     -->Fast Development Server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR): When running the development server, Parcel leverages HMR, a powerful feature that 
     allows you to see changes in your code instantly without requiring a full page reload. This significantly speeds up the development process, making 
     it more efficient and enjoyable. HMR is particularly beneficial for larger projects where the traditional manual refresh becomes time-consuming.


what is '.gitignore'? what should we add and not add into it?
