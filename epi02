//what is NPM?
ans: It's a library and registry for JavaScript software packages.

//what is parcel/webpack?why do we need it?
ans: Parcel and webpack are the bundlers used mostly for JavaScript or Typescript code that helps you to minify, clean, and make your code compact 
so that it becomes easier to send a request or receive the response from the server

//what is '.parcel-cache'?
ans: .parcel-cache stores information about your project when parcel builds it, so that when it rebuilds, it doesn't have to re-parse and re-analyze everything 
from scratch. It's a key reason why parcel can be so fast in development mode.

//what is npx?
ans: NPX stands for Node Package eXecute. It is simply an NPM package runner. It allows developers to execute any Javascript Package available on the NPM registry
without even installing it. NPX is installed automatically with NPM version.

//what is difference between dependencies vs Devdependencies?
ans:  Dependencies are the packages that are required for your application to run correctly in a production environment. These packages are essential 
for the normal functioning of your application and are typically needed during runtime. They include libraries, frameworks, and other utilities that your
application relies on to perform its core functionality.
When you deploy your application to a production server or share it with others, these dependencies are necessary for it to work properly.

DevDependencies, on the other hand, are packages that are only required during development and not in the production environment. These packages include 
development tools, testing frameworks, build systems, and other utilities used to support your development workflow.
DevDependencies are not deployed with your application when it goes into production because they are not needed for the end-users to use the application.


//what is Tree shaking?
ans: Tree shaking is a term commonly used within a JavaScript context to describe the removal of dead code.

//what is Hot Module Replacement?
ans:  Hot Module Replacement is a feature that enables you to see code changes in the browser without having to refresh it

//List out the 5 superpowers of parcel and describe them any 3 of them?
ans:--> Zero Configuration: Parcel is known for its zero-configuration setup, which means you can start using it right away without the need for complex 
configuration files. It automatically handles various aspects of your project, like transpiling, bundling, and code splitting, using sensible defaults. This simplicity allows developers to focus more on writing code and less on configuring build tools.

    -->Automatic Asset Resolution: Parcel can handle various asset types, such as JavaScript, CSS, HTML, images, and more, without requiring explicit 
    imports or configurations. It automatically recognizes dependencies from your code and bundles them appropriately, streamlining the development process 
    and reducing manual intervention.

     -->Fast Development Server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR): When running the development server, Parcel leverages HMR, a powerful feature that 
     allows you to see changes in your code instantly without requiring a full page reload. This significantly speeds up the development process, making 
     it more efficient and enjoyable. HMR is particularly beneficial for larger projects where the traditional manual refresh becomes time-consuming.


//what is '.gitignore'? what should we add and not add into it?
ans:  The . gitignore file tells Git which files to ignore when committing your project to the GitHub repository.

//what is the difference between package.json and package-lock.json?
ans: package.json is the standard metadata file for a Node.js project. It contains information about the project, such as its name, version, author, dependencies, scripts, and more.
The file is used to list all the packages (dependencies) that the project requires to run correctly.
It also specifies the version ranges of the required packages, allowing for flexibility when installing dependencies, as long as they meet the specified criteria.
Developers manually edit this file to add or remove dependencies or to update version ranges.

package-lock.json is automatically generated by npm (Node Package Manager) when you install or update dependencies in your project.
It is intended to be a deterministic and detailed record of the exact package versions that were installed in the node_modules folder. This ensures that the same versions of packages are installed across different environments and builds, providing consistency and reproducibility.
The file contains the exact versions of each dependency, including their sub-dependencies and their resolved locations.
The purpose of this file is to prevent subtle discrepancies between environments and to avoid potential dependency version conflicts.

//why should not i modify the package-lock.json?
ans: Consistency and Reproducibility: The whole point of using the package-lock.json file is to ensure that all team members and different environments use exactly the same versions of dependencies. If you modify the file, you might introduce discrepancies and inconsistencies, leading to unexpected behavior in the project.
     Dependency Conflicts: The package-lock.json file is carefully generated to resolve dependency conflicts and ensure that the correct versions of dependencies are installed. Manually changing the file can lead to conflicts and break the project.

//what is node module is that good idea to push it on git?
No, because of size and performance,redudancy, version control overhead.

//what is 'dist' folder?
ans:    The "dist" folder, short for "distribution," is a commonly used directory in software development projects, especially in web development. It is typically used to store the final output of the project after it has been built, processed, and optimized for production deployment.

//what is browserlist read about dif bundlers:vite,parcel,webpack?
ans: Browserslist defines and shares the list of target browsers between various frontend build tools.
